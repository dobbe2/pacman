# Pac-Man

As an avid Pac-Man player, and as a father of a 2 year old who has show early skills of playing Pac-Man, I wanted to create my own version of Pac-Man! 

I followed a tutorial by Ania Kubow https://github.com/kubowania to create the basic board and layout.  I am going to add my own personal style to this, and work on making things a little more fluid in the "gameplay".

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript


## Play Pac-Man Here!

## Items to work on

- Add styling to make game look more appealing and sharp.
- Add functionality to make controls more similar to Pac-Man where one keypress keeps his direction moving until another direction is pressed, or a wall is hit.
- Add AI to the ghosts so they "chase" pacman around the board.  Right now, their movement is random.
